      This is a text-based “choices matter” game that I had so much fun making.
      It’s built using IntelliJ IDEA and Java. The original idea was to make a
      combat game with a health bar, but I spun it around completely and made a
      dating sim with a charm meter instead. The game has three possible
      endings, depending on your charm meter score. Building this game allowed
      for so much creativity, I had a blast while coming up with funny ideas of
      what to implement. I see endless possibilities in the game and would love
      to implement more crazy scenarios and ideas.

      This is a mobile app, built using Android Studio and Kotlin. Once again, I
      had a blast making this quiz game. I got the app idea while casually
      browsing the web and an ad pops up suggesting I should subscribe to a
      newsletter with Donald Trump's craziest quote of the week. The app
      presents you with one crazy quote after the other, and the player's job is
      to figure out if Trump said it or not (the false Trump quotes are actually
      Kanye West quotes).

      This is a hybrid app, built using Visual Studio Code and React Native.
      Here I got the chance to combine both my passions and create something
      through it – programming, and gaming. It’s a simple quiz that helps come
      up with suggestions for what games you should try out next – based on your
      answers. The four pictures above are the games that I implemented as
      possible suggestions. I tried to pick a good mix of games, predominantly
      indie games that not everybody has played.
